The story of Father Crespi is a mysterious and controversial account of a priest in Ecuador involving claims of unknown civilizations, strange golden artifacts, a subterranean cave system containing a metallic library, depictions of figures connecting America to Sumer, symbols depicting an unknown language, and a Vatican conspiracy involving thousands of missing artifacts. Ancient Origins undertook an investigation to find out how much of the story is true. While our initial enquiries produced valuable information, our latest explorations concluded in being urged to stop pursuing further investigations into the missing artifacts. If you have not yet read the first article, please read it here before proceeding with this update. To summarize the results of our findings, our investigations determined that: Father Crespi’s collection is not missing but was purchased by the Central Bank of Ecuador and is currently stored in their museum vaults. The majority of Crespi’s collection consists of authentic and valuable artifacts gathered from around Ecuador. The so-called Metallic Library mentioned by Eric von Däniken in his controversial book ‘The Gold of the Gods’ is nothing more than modern-day carvings on cheap metal. A small subset of artifacts, which were photographed and filmed in the 1970s, consisting of gold carvings, hieroglyphs and Sumerian figures is genuinely missing and no one seems to have the answers as to where they are located and what their significance is.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"HackMD","slug":"hackMD","date":"2020-01-22T09:14:02.038Z","updated":"2020-01-22T09:22:06.541Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/22/hackMD/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/22/hackMD/","excerpt":"","text":"Features English version 中文版 日本語版 Do not modify this note.

Different formatting contexts lay out their boxes according to different rules. For example, a flex formatting context lays out boxes according to the flex layout rules [CSS3-FLEXBOX], whereas a block formatting context lays out boxes according to the block-and-inline layout rules [CSS2]. Additionally, some types of formatting contexts interleave and co-exist: for example, an inline formatting context exists within and interacts with the block formatting context of the element that establishes it, and a ruby container overlays a ruby formatting context over the inline formatting context in which its ruby base container participates. A box either establishes a new independent formatting context or continues the formatting context of its containing block. In some cases, it might additionally establish a new (non-independent) co-existing formatting context. Unless otherwise specified, however, establishing a new formatting context creates an independent formatting context. The type of formatting context established by the box is determined by its inner display type. E.g. a grid container establishes a new grid formatting context, a ruby container establishes a new ruby formatting context, and a block container can establish a new block formatting context and/or a new inline formatting context. See the display property. BFC(Block formatting context) 在了解BFC時，會有一些術語需要釐清，block-level boxes是元素產生的block box，blocks containing boxes是包含後代元素的block box，這兩者都可單稱為block box。 當一個box-level box參與了BFC佈局，它會撐滿整個容器寬度，並垂直向下排列，而如果box內包含了其它子元素，它本身成為了block containing box(塊容器)（也可稱為block container），它內部也是一個BFC的佈局環境： 後代box的左外緣貼住它的左內緣。（如果flow是由右往左，則是子元素的右外緣貼著它的右內緣。） 後代的 block box垂直排列，它本身會被垂直往下排列的box撐高（也能水平排列，如果它包含的是inline element的話）。 垂直排列的box與box之間區隔的是margin，這些垂直排列的margin會有collapse的現象。 範例： 12345&lt;div class=\"parent\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"child\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"child\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"child\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; .parent本身為block box，參與了BFC佈局，而它本身又是block container，對內創造BFC佈局環境給後代元素。它的子元素.child本身參與BFC佈局，佔滿容器寬度，垂直向下排列，box之間的垂直間隔用margin區別（相鄰的box垂直方向margin會有collapse現象）。 創建新的BFC(Block formatting context) 以下條件會觸發元素創建新的BFC： 根元素&lt;html&gt; 元素的float參數不為none 元素的position參數為absolute或fixed 元素的display參數為inline-block 元素的display參數為table-cell(HTML表格欄預設為該值) 元素的display參數為table-caption（HTML表格標題預設為該值） 元素的display參數為table, table-row, table-row-group, table-header-group, table-footer-group（分別是HTML&lt;table&gt;、&lt;row&gt;、&lt;tbody&gt;、&lt;thead&gt;、&lt;tfoot&gt;的預設值） overflow參數不為visible的block元素 display參數為flow-root的元素 contain參數為layout、content或paint的元素 display參數為flex或inline-flex元素的子元素 display參數為grid或inline-grid元素的子元素 元素的column-count或column-width參數不為auto，包括column-count: 1 column-span為all的元素始終會創建一個新的BFC。 創建一個新的BFC可以把它想成是，為了讓這個元素在某些條件下，仍然可以像個箱子一樣裝東西，所以創建一個新的BFC佈局環境給它。目前可能還不會有感覺，但我們可以在之後提到的float屬性、positon屬性值為absolute時再來認識它的作用。 今天的筆記告一段落，明天見～ *有任何錯誤或描述不夠精準之處，歡迎指教，非常感謝。","categories":[{"name":"web","slug":"web","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/web/"}],"tags":[{"name":"css","slug":"css","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/css/"}]},{"title":"context）","slug":"context）","date":"2020-01-22T08:46:28.000Z","updated":"2020-01-22T08:46:28.037Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/22/context）/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/22/context%EF%BC%89/","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"ByeBye world","slug":"ByeBye-world","date":"2020-01-14T07:57:02.000Z","updated":"2020-01-22T08:26:42.893Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/14/ByeBye-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/14/ByeBye-world/","excerpt":"","text":"HaHaHa","categories":[{"name":"web","slug":"web","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/web/"}],"tags":[{"name":"demo","slug":"demo","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/demo/"}]},{"title":"Hola World","slug":"Hola-World","date":"2020-01-14T07:51:17.000Z","updated":"2020-01-22T08:26:46.179Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/14/Hola-World/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/14/Hola-World/","excerpt":"","text":"Tis is just a article for demo.","categories":[{"name":"blog","slug":"blog","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/blog/"}],"tags":[{"name":"demo","slug":"demo","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/demo/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2020-01-14T05:11:34.524Z","updated":"2020-01-14T05:11:34.524Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/14/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/14/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
